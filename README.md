attiny-adc-i2c
==============

This is a two channel analogue digital converter example project using I2C communication mainly to use with the Raspberry Pi. However, it will work with other setups using avrdude and ISP programmers. You'll need the files for <a href="https://github.com/eriksl/usitwislave">usitwi / I2C communication</a> installed - this library actually works :). You can read on how to <a href="http://mihalysprojects.weebly.com/blog/setting-up-i2c-between-an-attiny-tiny-avr-and-a-raspberry-pi">setup I2C communication between a Raspberry Pi and an ATtiny here on my blog</a>.
